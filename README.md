rhlbot
======

Code related to driving the SCORBOT-ER III that is on loan to Rogue Hack Lab.

If you connect the controller to the serial port on dev.roguehacklab.com 
(the Dell machine by the front door) and run rhlbot.py, you can control the 
robot arm using the Logitech Extreme 3D joystick.

If you want to use the arm to aim a webcam, try 'camorama'
